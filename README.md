**Want you more 😬 ?**

I have developed lots of web, mobile and desktop applications for 10+ years. I always try to choose the best language and technology for what I do. It is also a joy for me to read and search new and best technologies for my job. Teaching is one of my hobbies. I believe "teaching is the best way to learn and to help society.". I believe that being open-minded is a must in my job. As a matter of fact I am trying to help Open Source Projects too.

I know how to ask questions to my best teacher Google. Therefore, learning has been always a piece of cake to me and I love cakes very much 😇
